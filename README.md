## Overview

This **Kalshi-Poly / Poly-Poly / Kalshi-Kalshi arbitrage bot** identifies and executes arbitrage opportunities across:

- **Kalshi-Poly markets** (cross-platform arbitrage between Kalshi and Polymarket)
- **Poly-Poly markets** (same-platform arbitrage on Polymarket)
- **Kalshi-Kalshi markets** (same-platform arbitrage on Kalshi)

The bot takes both sides of a market when YES and NO prices add up to less than $1.00, guaranteeing a risk-free profit at market expiry.

### How It Works

**Example Opportunity:**
- YES = $0.40, NO = $0.58
- Total cost = $0.98
- At expiry: YES = $1.00 and NO = $0.00 (or vice versa)
- **Result: 2.04% risk-free return**

### Market Insights

When observing large traders like PN1 finding significant size in these opportunities, the initial assumption was that opportunities would be extremely fleeting with intense competition. However, the reality is quite different:

- **Opportunities are persistent**: While concurrent dislocations aren't frequent, when they do occur, they persist long enough to execute manually
- **Large traders use limit orders**: Whales typically fill positions via limit orders over extended periods, as odds don't fluctuate significantly before game time
- **Manual execution is viable**: Opportunities remain available long enough for manual intervention if needed

### System Workflow

The repository implements the following workflow:

1. **Market Scanning**: Scans sports markets that expire within the next couple of days
2. **Market Matching**: Matches Kalshi-Polymarket markets using:
   - Cached mapping of team names between platforms
   - Kalshi-Polymarket event slug building conventions
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Subscribes to orderbook delta WebSockets to detect instances where YES + NO can be purchased for less than $1.00
4. **Order Execution**: Executes trades concurrently on both platforms
5. **Risk Management**: Includes position management and circuit breakers (note: not extensively battle-tested in production)

### Useful Components

Beyond the complete arbitrage system, you may find these components particularly useful:

- **Cross-platform market mapping**: The team code mapping system for matching markets across Kalshi and Polymarket
- **Rust CLOB client**: A Rust rewrite of Polymarket's Python `py-clob-client` (focused on order submission only)

## How It Works

### Arbitrage Mechanics

In prediction markets, the fundamental property holds: **YES + NO = $1.00** (guaranteed).

This **Polymarket arbitrage bot** and **Polymarket-Kalshi arbitrage bot** exploits this property by detecting when:

```
Best YES ask (Platform A) + Best NO ask (Platform B) < $1.00
```

**Example Scenario (Kalshi-Poly Arbitrage):**

```
Kalshi YES ask:  42¢
Polymarket NO ask: 56¢
Total cost:      98¢
Guaranteed payout: 100¢
Net profit:       2¢ per contract (2.04% return)
```

The bot automatically executes both legs simultaneously, locking in the risk-free profit.

### Arbitrage Opportunity Types

This **Kalshi-Poly / Poly-Poly / Kalshi-Kalshi arbitrage bot** supports four types of arbitrage opportunities:

| Type                 | Execution Strategy                          | Frequency | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `poly_yes_kalshi_no` | Buy Polymarket YES + Buy Kalshi NO          | Common    | **Kalshi-Poly**: Cross-platform arbitrage |
| `kalshi_yes_poly_no` | Buy Kalshi YES + Buy Polymarket NO          | Common    | **Kalshi-Poly**: Cross-platform arbitrage |
| `poly_only`          | Buy Polymarket YES + Buy Polymarket NO      | Rare      | **Poly-Poly**: Same-platform arbitrage |
| `kalshi_only`        | Buy Kalshi YES + Buy Kalshi NO              | Rare      | **Kalshi-Kalshi**: Same-platform arbitrage |

### Fee Structure

- **Kalshi**: Trading fees calculated as `ceil(0.07 × contracts × price × (1-price))` - automatically factored into arbitrage detection
- **Polymarket**: Zero trading fees on all orders
